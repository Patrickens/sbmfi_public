# simulation based metabolic flux inference

This is the public version of the `sbmfi` package. I am still finishing up the package in a separate private repository.
The workings of the simulator are demonstrated in the `sbmfi_demo` notebook.

## Installation

Cloning from `github` for now, once finished I will get it to `pip` install
